# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves developing and evaluating two supervised machine learning models to classify emails as spam or not spam. The models aim to improve the email filtering system for an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Using the provided dataset, the models will be trained, tested, and evaluated to determine which model performs better at accurately detecting spam emails.

## Objectives

- Develop a logistic regression model and a random forest model for email spam detection.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.
- Scale the features to improve model performance.
- Compare the models' performance using accuracy scores.

## Files

The following file is used in this project:

- `spam_detector.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for building, training, and evaluating the models.
- Dataset: The data is sourced from [Spam Data CSV](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv).

## Prerequisites

Before starting the assignment, complete the following steps:

1. Create a new repository named `classification-challenge`.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Add the starter file `spam_detector.ipynb` to the repository.
4. Push the changes to your GitHub or GitLab repository.


## Expected Output

- A comparison of accuracy scores for the logistic regression and random forest models.
- Insights into the better-performing model and the reasoning behind its performance.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open `spam_detector.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook spam_detector.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including model evaluations and insights, will be documented in the notebook. Ensure all code cells are executed, and the findings are clearly summarized in the final Markdown cells.
